# Amenitiz Cash Register

## Overview

Welcome to the Amenitiz Cash Register! This easy to use CLI application is built
using Ruby, and allows users to view a selection of different products, add
these products to their cart and see a total price at checkout with special
discounting rules implemented where applicable.

## About the project

We built this application to bring our C-Suite's passion for providing healthy
snacks at low prices to life for Amenitiz employees.

## Features

• Users can browser the selection of available products and their prices.
• Users can chose to add items to their cart using unique item codes, or
checkout and view their bill at any time.
• The application computes a total final price at checkout, inclusive of special
pricing rules and discounts specified by senior management.
